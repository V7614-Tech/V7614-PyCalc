# V7614 PyCalc

*V7614 PyCalc* is a console-based calculator written in Python by [Vincent V7614](https://github.com/V7614), designed for Windows (and Linux with Wine).  
It features simple math support and continuing equations.

This is my first Python project! Releases may be a bit late if there are bugs that need fixing.  
V7614 PyCalc is a Python Script made with Python 3.13.0 that is packaged into a Windows `.exe` file!
Updates will be rolled out 3 times a week, specifically, Sunday, Wednesday, and Saturday, unless specified
