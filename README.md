For those with GitHub accounts:  
- Open an issue in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/V7614-Tech/V7614-PyCalc/issues) describing your antivirus and the detection.

# üìù Note to other people with a project name similar to PyCalc

V7614 PyCalc was originally called **Python Calculator**, made to help me master Python.  
I later shortened its name to **PyCalc**, and very recently rebranded again before the release on GitHub.  
It turns out the name was already used, so I rebranded it again.

**V7614 PyCalc and Chill Astro's PyCalc are two separate projects, and none of us copied each other.**  
I just had an idea while learning Python.  

Hope this clears up any confusion with other PyCalc projects.  

‚Äì Yours truly, Vincent V7614

# Note from the developer!

V7614 PyCalc's updates will be delayed because of schoolwork, sorry to have you waiting!

# **V7614 PyCalc**

*V7614 PyCalc* is a console-based calculator written in Python by [Vincent V7614](https://github.com/V7614), designed for **Windows** (and **Linux with Wine**).  
It supports basic math operations and continuing equations.

This is my first Python project! Releases may be a bit late if bugs need fixing.  
V7614 PyCalc is made with **Python 3.13.0** and packaged into a Windows `.exe` file.  

**Update Schedule:** Sunday, and Saturday (unless specified otherwise).

## üÜï News!

> 13th August 2025: V7614 PyCalc 1.1.0 will add **NATIVE** support for Debian/Ubuntu based distros, and coming with this is source code for V7614 PyCalc version 1.1.0 will be out as well, since after the rewrite the old code will be useless, so there it will be for people learning Python (V7614 PyCalc 2.0.0 won't get this treatment because by then, it is too complex for begginers and it's source code won't be open to the publis)
