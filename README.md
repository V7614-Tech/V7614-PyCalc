# PyCalc

*PyCalc* is a console-based calculator written in Python by me ([V7614](https://github.com/V7614)).  
It features simple math support, and continuing equations.
Hi! This is my first Python project.  I may be late with the releases because there might be bugs to fix. It is a Windows executable (.exe) file in the zip so you can run it straight from the zip. The old versions of PyCalc (PyCalc Classic 1.0.0 - 1.0.3 InDev Preview 1) used to be released as a normal Python script, it is now packaged using Auto Py To Exe into a Windows executable.
Releases and their codenames (Some of these are only plans and might change in the future):

##‚òëÔ∏è Requirements

Minimum Requirements for PyCalc Classic 1.0.X and above:

  Affected versions: PyCalc Classic 1.0.2 and 1.0.3 InDev Preview 1
  Fixed?: Yes, in PyCalc Alpha 1.1.0 InDev Preview 1
  Workaround for affected PyCalc versions?:  None, just update to PyCalc Alpha 1.1.0. Sorry for the inconvenience.

3. Square and Square Root does not work. Intended action is for it to work obviously
Affected versions: PyCalc Classic 1.0.3 InDev Preview 1
Fixed?: No
Workaround for affected PyCalc versions?: None, square and square root can be done through the power(**) option. Just do that instead.
