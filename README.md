# V7614 PyCalc

*V7614 PyCalc* is a console-based calculator written in Python by [Vincent V7614](https://github.com/V7614), designed for Windows (and Linux with Wine).  
It features simple math support and continuing equations.

This is my first Python project! Releases may be a bit late if bugs need fixing.  
PyCalc is packaged as a Windows executable (`.exe`) inside a `.zip` file.
Updates will be rolled out 3 times a week, specifically, Sunday, Wednesday, and Saturday
