# V7614 PyCalc

*V7614 PyCalc* is a console-based calculator written in Python by me for Windows ([V7614](https://github.com/V7614)).  
It features simple math support, and continuing equations.
Hi! This is my first Python project.  I may be late with the releases because there might be bugs to fix. It is a Windows executable (.exe) file in the zip file.
